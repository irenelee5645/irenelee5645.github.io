Interactive game that simulates a farm. Users can plant, water, harvest, and sell crops. Users may encounter natural disasters such as drought and locust attack.
I primarily worked on backend, doing class design, dependency management, and implementation.

* [Watch Demo video](https://tinyurl.com/farmsimulation)
* The source code for the project is not open for the public.
