Im2Vec is a language model approach to visualizing and understanding images in image classification task. Im2Vec generates image embedding vectors for each class of image and shows relationship among images of different classes.

### Abstract
*In this work we present Im2Vec, a novel approach to understanding the images in image classification task. Whereas conventional methods for weight visualization have tried to generate images from the weights of trained models, we sought to derive a numerical representationâ€“ image embedding vectors. The idea is adopted from Word2Vec, a method to encode relationship among words into word embedding vector. Im2Vec uses the pixel val- ues of each image as the context for its classification, sim- ilar to the context words in skip-gram model. By do- ing so, the generated image embedding vectors can re- flect the relative importance of each pixel for each class as well as show relationship between different classes via the proximity between vectors of corresponding classes*
