Hi, I am Irene, a student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, especially in the field of Deep Learning.  My research interest includes computer vision, natural language and neural architecture search. 

My Research
======
I am currently part of [Georgia Tech's Social and Language Technologies (SALT)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/group.html) Lab, which studies Social NLP. I am involved in two projects in the lab. In the first project, we study humor and develop classifier and generator with the goal of publish an interactive bot that provides various jokes. The other research studies data augmentation for language models.

Along with the NLP research, I am involved in Seoul National University's Software Platform Lab. Here, we analyze various deep learning tools and architectures with a goal of developing an optimized deep learning platform for faster training and inference. In the lab, I study input pipeline for various deep learning architectures in order to develop a faster input pipelining system.

My past research was on Lemotif project led by [Alice Li](mailto:xaliceli@gmail.com) & [Devi Parikh](mailto:deviparikh@gmail.com), for which I created an IOS application.  Lemotif is an intuitive journalling tool that embodies semantic analysis and image generation.

Community
======
At Georgia Tech, I am involved in [Honors Program](http://www.honorsprogram.gatech.edu/) Living Learning Community. In the program, we  actively engage with our faculty to explore each field of study in depth. We try to advance the Georgia Tech mission of â€œProgress and Service" as we pursue our degree at Georgia Tech. One of the most meaningful course that I took as part of the program was *Near Peer Mentoring*. In this class, we explored social bias in education and mentored high school students who are affected by this bias.

I am part of the leadership team of [Data Science @ Georgia Tech](https://datasciencegt.org/) (DSGT) and Hacklytics. DSGT is a community of students passionate about data science. We hold workshops and various tech talks to help our data scientists pursue their passion. At DSGT, as a Corporate Outreach person, I reach out to potential club sponsors and maintain relations with our current sponsors as well as plan guest talks. Hacklytics is an annual data science hackathon hosted by DSGT. Here, I work under Operations Team also as a Corporate Outreach person. We  organize various workshops and special guest talks so that we can provide the best experience for participants. (If you are interested in joining DSGT or Hacklytics team please reach out to me!)

I am also a member of [Programming Team](http://programmingteam.cc.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. We learn and study various data structures and algorithms and prepare for competitive programming competitions such as ICPC.
